<!--
Given an integer array, find three numbers whose product is maximum and output
the maximum product.

Example 1:
Input: [1,2,3]
Output: 6
Example 2:
Input: [1,2,3,4]
Output: 24
Note:
The length of the given array will be in range [3,104] and all elements are in
the range [-1000, 1000].
Multiplication of any three numbers in the input won't exceed the range of
32-bit signed integer.

<!-- The negative numbers here threw me off. I didn't
consider them becoming positive with multiplication -->
